          A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle used
          to carry a payload from Earth's surface to space, usually to Earth
          orbit or beyond. Our WEB-X carrier rocket is the most powerful in
          operation. Standing 150 metres tall, it's quite an awe-inspiring sight
          on the launch pad!

          A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body
          reentry capsule to reenter the Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our
          capsule is where you'll spend your time during the flight. It includes
